**Command:** `cd`

**Using** `cd` **with no argument:**

Working directory when command ran: `/home`

After entering `cd` into the terminal with no arguments, there was no output produced, indicating that the program ran successfully. But after checking the working directory, the working directory after the command ran was the same as before the command ran, because there was no argument alongside `cd`, so the directory was not changed at all.



**Using** `cd` **with the argument being a path to a directory:**

Working directory when command ran: `/home`

After I entered `cd` into the terminal with the argument `lecture1`, there was also no output produced so the command ran successfully and this was not an error. But I had checked the working directory after, and instead of `/home` it was `/home/lecture1`. Although there was no output produced, the working directory changed which can be seen in the text before where I was able to type, where instead of `[user@sahara ~]$` it was `[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$`.
