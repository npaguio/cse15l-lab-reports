# Nathan Paguio - Lab Report 5


#### Student: So I've been having a problem with my `NumPattern.java` code and I don't know why it's failing. I've looked over the code a few times after forking it but I probably can't think at the moment, I sent a screenshot of my symptom below. Looking at it, I believe that I'm not adding the right number values to my `List<Integer>` object that's being returned, following a different pattern to what I expected.
